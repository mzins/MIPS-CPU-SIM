# MIPS-CPU-SIM
Simulates MIPS CPU architecture covered in 605.611 Foundations of Computer Architecture

Currently only supports basic instructions ADD and ADDI.. PC update and Jumps coming soon

Set what you want in registers and memory before execution in configurations/registers.py and configurations/memory.py

Start simulation by running start.py
Example instructions
